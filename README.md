# Ready to play

To improve the full stack part a of Alex's template further, this extension integrate Prisma and provide the guideline to easily create and connect a Postgre database.
Also, Next-Auth is implemented and Docker is ready for deployement.

First, start with "yarn install" in the console from the root folder.

# Creating your Postgres

Download Postgres SQL from https://www.postgresql.org/ .
When ready create an empty folder in your Next application root folder named "database" or whatever you like (There is already one, feel free to change its name).
From Postgres, create a new server.
When setting up, set the source to your empty folder so it generates the database there.

Be sure that the server is running.

# Initialize Prisma

You can initialize prisma with : "npx prisma init"

# Connect your Postgre

A .env file has been generated. Now, you will change the DATABASE_URL variable to the Database connection URL string of your Postgres.
In a basic local configuration, it should look like : "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:PORT/DBNAME"

# Create your first model in Prisma

In schema.prisma, create your model (you will find a model user as default). When you are done enter this command : "npx prixma db push" .

You should see this message : ðŸš€ Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema.
If not, it's probably a problem with the Database connection URL string of your Postgres, check again that your postgres server is running.

As another check, you can use this command : "npx prisma studio". It'll launch a visual interface to interact with your database.

# Generate your prisma client

With this command, generate your prisma client : "npx prisma generate"
You'll have to run this command everytime you make a change to your prisma.schema file.
